	abstract = {Cloud computing promises flexibility and high performance for users and high cost-efficiency for operators. Nevertheless, most cloud facilities operate at very low utilization, hurting both cost effectiveness and future scalability.We present Quasar, a cluster management system that increases resource utilization while providing consistently high application performance. Quasar employs three techniques. First, it does not rely on resource reservations, which lead to underutilization as users do not necessarily understand workload dynamics and physical resource requirements of complex codebases. Instead, users express performance constraints for each workload, letting Quasar determine the right amount of resources to meet these constraints at any point. Second, Quasar uses classification techniques to quickly and accurately determine the impact of the amount of resources (scale-out and scale-up), type of resources, and interference on performance for each workload and dataset. Third, it uses the classification results to jointly perform resource allocation and assignment, quickly exploring the large space of options for an efficient way to pack workloads on available resources. Quasar monitors workload performance and adjusts resource allocation and assignment when needed. We evaluate Quasar over a wide range of workload scenarios, including combinations of distributed analytics frameworks and low-latency, stateful services, both on a local cluster and a cluster of dedicated EC2 servers. At steady state, Quasar improves resource utilization by 47\% in the 200-server EC2 cluster, while meeting performance constraints for workloads of all types.},

	abstract = {With advances in virtualization technology, virtual machine services offered by cloud utility providers are becoming increasingly powerful, anchoring the ecosystem of cloud services. Virtual computing services are attractive in part because they enable customers to acquire and release computing resources for guest applications adaptively in response to load surges and other dynamic behaviors. ``Elastic'' cloud computing APIs present a natural opportunity for feedback controllers to automate this adaptive resource provisioning, and many recent works have explored feedback control policies for a variety of network services under various assumptions.This paper addresses the challenge of building an effective controller as a customer add-on outside of the cloud utility service itself. Such external controllers must function within the constraints of the utility service APIs. It is important to consider techniques for effective feedback control using cloud APIs, as well as how to design those APIs to enable more effective control. As one example, we explore proportional thresholding, a policy enhancement for feedback controllers that enables stable control across a wide range of guest cluster sizes using the coarse-grained control offered by popular virtual compute cloud services.},

	abstract = {The advancements and rapid adoption of service oriented architecture, utility computing, virtualization, etc., have emerged in a new computing paradigm called cloud computing, in the last few years. Cloud computing enables on-demand delivery of data, software, and hardware in the form of services over the Internet. But the growing scale of cloud-users and type-of-services urge for an autonomous environment to automate the highly complex cloud environment in a suitable way to improve the overall management of the cloud systems. To counter these automation related issues, autonomic computing (AC) emerges as a potential solution to optimize the performance of cloud computing. The merge of these two prominent technologies gives rise to a new technological domain called autonomic cloud computing (ACC). In this survey article, the existing AC assisted solutions for cloud computing is broadly categorized into two groups, namely features based and parameters based. Features based solutions are further classified into management (of services, workload, and resources) and security aware solutions. Similarly, parameters based solutions are grouped into quality-of-service aware and performance management solutions. Finally, the comparative analysis of state-of-the-art ACC approaches with respect to the approach referred, performance metrics, outcome, and the derived inference is also presented to have an in-depth understanding of the existing literature. Overall, the work excites the research community to design the effective autonomous solutions for ACC resources and services. Additionally, several research gaps and challenges are identified and discussed in this article based on the study with a focus on the future research directions.},

	abstract = {Predictive autoscaling (autoscaling with workload forecasting) is an important mechanism that supports autonomous adjustment of computing resources in accordance with fluctuating workload demands in the Cloud. In recent works, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been introduced as a promising approach to learn the resource management policies to guide the scaling actions under the dynamic and uncertain cloud environment. However, RL methods face the following challenges in steering predictive autoscaling, such as lack of accuracy in decision-making, inefficient sampling and significant variability in workload patterns that may cause policies to fail at test time. To this end, we propose an end-to-end predictive meta model-based RL algorithm, aiming to optimally allocate resource to maintain a stable CPU utilization level, which incorporates a specially-designed deep periodic workload prediction model as the input and embeds the Neural Process to guide the learning of the optimal scaling actions over numerous application services in the Cloud. Our algorithm not only ensures the predictability and accuracy of the scaling strategy, but also enables the scaling decisions to adapt to the changing workloads with high sample efficiency. Our method has achieved significant performance improvement compared to the existing algorithms and has been deployed online at Alipay, supporting the autoscaling of applications for the world-leading payment platform.},
